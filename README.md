# Java-learning-dairy
# This is my Java learning process, I start at zero basic learning, so a lot of code is still in the basic state. I wrote a file called JavaReadme, which is my mind about learning the basics of Java.
#This file called JavaReadme is mainly recorded with Chinese, so friends who don't understand Chinese can use Google Translate to translate it.
